# Base Program Names Canonical Mapping
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file contains the authoritative mapping from base program name variations
# to their canonical (standardized) names for the University Admission Prediction
# System.
#
# SOURCE: OUInfo Program Categories, OUAC Program Database
# UPDATED: 2024
#
# ==============================================================================
#                              FILE FORMAT
# ==============================================================================
#
#   Canonical Name:
#     - variation1
#     - variation2
#     - ...
#
# All variations are matched CASE-INSENSITIVELY after stripping:
#   - Degree prefixes (BSc, BA, BEng, etc.)
#   - Honours designation
#   - Co-op designation
#   - Specialization suffixes in parentheses
#
# ==============================================================================
#                           USAGE IN SYSTEM
# ==============================================================================
#
# The ProgramNormalizer first extracts components (degree, honours, co-op,
# specialization), then uses this file to standardize the base program name.

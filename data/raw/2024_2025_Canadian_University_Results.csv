Then, I got a question like “What is critical thinking and why is it important to you?” where I just yapped (“as engineers/problem solving/considerate of others’ opinions”). Then for my third video, I mentioned that I wanted to MC for a cultural event at the local volunteer/non-profit organization (the question was something along the lines of if I felt like I had let someone down, what did I do about it and how did it turn out) that I’m a volunteer at, but I couldn’t MC because I had to get vaccinated that day. I felt like I had let them down because I informed them the night before, even if they were okay with it.

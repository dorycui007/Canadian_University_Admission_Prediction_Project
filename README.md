# Canadian_University_Admission_Prediction_Project
Canadian high school students face uncertainty about admission chances. They must decide where to apply, how many "safety" vs "reach" schools to include, and when to expect decisions—all without reliable data. This project builds a prediction system to answer: **"Given my average and target program, what are my chances?"**
